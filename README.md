# It Doesnâ€™t Look Like Anything to Me: Using Diffusion Model to Subvert Visual Phishing Detectors

The repository contains code and sampled datasets to generate adversarial logos that subvert Visual Phishing Detectors. The attack method, LogoMorph, generates adversarial logos that have a large perceptual distance from original logos but with semantic-preserving changes. We show visual examples of adversarial logo images and webpage screenshots that bypass the state-of-the-art visual phishing detectors. We also include some example screenshots taken from a user study conducted to evaluate the quality of the adversarial logos and adversarial webpages. 

Please note that this repository is **under-construction**. More polished code and extra datasets will be uploaded soon.

## Usage
We train the unconditional diffusion for each target phishing brand: 

### 2.1 Train LogoMorph
Using Bank of America (BOA) as an example, the example command to train the adversarial diffusion model image is given in experiments/diffusion/train.sh. The command to train LogoMorph using the **Blackbox** weights is in /experiments/diffusion/blackbox/train_b.sh. Our model weights will be uploaded later. 

### 2.2 Sample Logo Images
The example command to sample adversarial logo images from pretrained model weights is given in examples/diffusion/sample.sh. You can either train your own model or use our pretrained weights. Our pretrained weights will be uploaded later.
